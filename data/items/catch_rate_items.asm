; leftover catchrate items
; by the time Pokemon Ray is done, this list will be much shorter
; most story-related/glitch items will be replaced by entirely new items
; currently works exactly like GSC's does, albeit in a different context
; but has many more items appear on the table, even story-related items
; some of these entries are unused because pokemon can't hold key items
