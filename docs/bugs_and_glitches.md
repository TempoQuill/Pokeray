# Bugs and Glitches

These are known bugs and glitches in the Pok√©mon Ray and Shade games: code that clearly does not work as intended, or that only works in limited circumstances but has the possibility to fail or crash.

Fixes are written in the `diff` format. If you've used Git before, this should look familiar:

```diff
 this is some code
-delete red - lines
+add green + lines
```

## Values Stored Before Levels Determine the Battle Transition Animation

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eij_1060SMc))

There are three things wrong here:

- `wEnemyMonLevel` isn't initialized yet
- `wBattleMonLevel` gets overwritten after it's initialized by `FindFirstAliveMonAndStartBattle`
- `wBattleMonLevel` isn't initialized until much later when the battle is with a trainer

**Fix:**

First, edit [engine/battle/battle_transition.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/battle_transition.asm):

```diff
 StartTrainerBattle_DetermineWhichAnimation:
 ; The screen flashes a different number of times depending on the level of
 ; your lead Pokemon relative to the opponent's.
-; BUG: wBattleMonLevel and wEnemyMonLevel are not set at this point, so whatever
-; values happen to be there will determine the animation.
